# QA-gallery

Plotting macro and result gallery for standardized QA plots

The `main` branch carries common macros and utilities. And each QA plot setup is placed in their individual branches: 

* [`QA-calorimeter-single-particle` branch](https://github.com/sPHENIX-Collaboration/QA-gallery/tree/QA-calorimeter-single-particle ) : Full detector Calorimeter QA for single particles 
* Tracking branches to come...

The plotting branches are automatically synced with the `main` branch via GitHub actions. 

# Developper's guide

The plotting macros plot the default QA ROOT file via the sPHENIX Jupyter Lab environment. Both source code, documentation and result plots are saved in the Jupyter Notebook formats, such as [QA-calorimeter.ipynb](https://github.com/sPHENIX-Collaboration/QA-gallery/blob/QA-calorimeter-single-particle/QA-calorimeter.ipynb) and they can be best viewed via the `nbviewer` site ([example](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/sPHENIX-Collaboration/QA-gallery/blob/cb340543f08c4351fcf5787de1c495419ea2debd/QA-calorimeter.ipynb))

To edit the notebook, please checkout the plotting branches, and edit either with following environements: 

* sPHENIX JupyterLab via SDCC HTC Jupyter Hub, which provides both latest software and computing power. Here is an introduction: https://github.com/sPHENIX-Collaboration/tutorials/tree/master/JupyterLab

</a></p>

* sPHENIX JupyterLab runs locally on your local computer via [sPHENIX Singularity container](https://github.com/sPHENIX-Collaboration/Singularity). Please setup the [container](https://github.com/sPHENIX-Collaboration/Singularity), source sPHENIX setup, and run [`setup.sh`](https://github.com/sPHENIX-Collaboration/QA-gallery/blob/QA-calorimeter-single-particle/setup.sh) to start the sPHENIX JupyterLab webserver interface.
